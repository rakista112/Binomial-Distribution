name: Binomial Distribution
author: Ray John E. Alovera

This is a program that calculates the binomial distribution.
It uses the WPF so it won't run on other systems except Windows.

Made this for my homework in my Statistics class.
I used the equation our teacher gave us.
P(some event) = nCx * P^x * (1-p)^(n-x)
